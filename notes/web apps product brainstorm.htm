<pre><code> comic pull and hold list management tool
 code name: Comics Dispatch

 "Comics Dispatch" will allow its users to view and manage the comic books in his or her pull and hold list(s) -- a feature of many comic book stores that allows users to reserve specific titles before they go on shelves for purchase by the general public.  Although accessible by standard web browsers, the site will be focused on supporting users of smart phones or other mobile devices to provide a mobile list management service.

 Furthermore, the user may have the service weekly email him or her the list of comics being released that week as well as an estimated price for the items on the list (after applying any applicable, user-defined store discounts and sales taxes).  Similarly, the user may input his or her local comic book store owner's email address.  The system will then email any changes to the user's pull and hold list on a specified weekday.

 Eventually, the system might support store accounts.  These accounts will allow local comic book store owners to create accounts for their stores.  Users may then "attach" any of their pull and hold lists to the desired store so the owners can generate a report of comics to buy when they next have to order from Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc as well as keep a continually-updated pull and hold list for each customer.

<ol>
<li><p>Audience
The audience is comprised of smart-phone wielding comic book fans who desire to easily view or manage his or her pull lists at one or more local comic book stores.</p></li>
<li><p>Gap Analysis
A similar product is offered by the digital comics distributor Comixology; however, much room for growth is available in this area.  Comixology's website is not particularly mobile-friendly and feels very clunky to use-- especially its pull and hold section.  Comics Dispatch would focus on catering to mobile users to provide a well-designed, easy to use application.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Moreover, Comixology allows one to share his or her pull list with a retailer of his or her choice (as long as the retailer is also using Comixology).  However, not all comic book owners have computers in their stores.  Thus, Comics Dispatch would differ by allowing the system to email any changes to the store's owner, who could then update any necessary records at home and bring the changes to his or her store.  Similarly, CD's method of emailing the owner any changes instead of a complete list will make it easier for the retailer to update any necessary records.</p>

<p>Finally, Comixology allows a user to attach his or her pull list to only one retailer; Comics Dispatch will allow the user to maintain an arbitrarily large number of pull lists and assign them to any retailer(s) of his or her choice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cost Analysis
I could complete the design of the website as well as its underlying code on my own within approximately one to two weeks -- therefore, development costs would be negligible and approach zero.</li>
</ol>


<p>As the application wouldn't need specialized hardware or hosting environment (especially at first, and likely throughout its lifetime), I would choose NearlyFreeSpeech.net as its hosting provider.  Including domain name registration, the site is estimated to cost approximately $27.63 for one year (for 1GB of transfer per month) to $46.80 (for 5GB of transfer per month).  As the majority of the site will be small HTML files with a minimal number images (to better support mobile devices), I imagine data usage would fall toward the lower end of the scale.</p>

<p>There is also very minimal upkeep once the system is developed.  A script could be written to weekly parse the comic release information provided by Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc. at http://www.previewsworld.com/public/shipping/newreleases.txt and adds its information to the database.</p>

<ol>
<li>Revenue Estimate
Comic book fans are often voracious consumers of other comic book-,  superhero-, or other "nerdy"-based goods.  If the site becomes popular, I would attempt to create advertising relationships with producers of related content.  Although Google's Adsense or a similar ad provider could be an option (and would be very easy to implement), the expected audience is more likely to click through on ads that are incredibly related to their interests.</li>
</ol>


<p>In addition, it may also be possible to sell pull list history aggregates to comic book publishers/distributors if the site becomes popular and gains enough users.  These companies may be interested in learning the trend of comic book purchases over time as well as what books or genres are commonly purchased together.</p>

<p>Although hard to estimate the specific revenue, I imagine the site may be able to make a few hundred to a few thousand dollars for an incredibly minimal amount of work.  As more time is spent developing connections with partners, the amount of possible revenue would increase.</p>

<ol>
<li>Marketing
Initially, I would attempt to market this product mostly through local word of mouth.  If they were receptive to the idea, I would introduce my local comic book store owners to the service and discuss with them the benefits it offers for them and their customers.  Furthermore, I would then ask if they would mind displaying a small informational poster or discuss the product with their customers.  Hopefully these customers would then go on to discuss the product with any of their other comic-reading friends.  This initial feedback would be great to reflect upon to approve the service before later stages of marketing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Eventually, I would create small business cards for the service and distribute them to retailers and attendees at various comic conventions and festivals (like SteelCon and the Pittsburgh ComiCon).  If everything goes according to plan, these users will find the service helpful and share it with their friends, increasing the user base and spreading it out more geographically.</p>

<p>Along the way, I would make it easy for both types of users to share the website with their friends and acquaintances via social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus.</p>

<p>Possibly, should the service become popular and profitable, I could look into having somebody produce internet and comic book ads to share the service with other users around the world.</p>
