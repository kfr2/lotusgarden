<h1>Interview</h1>

<h2>Researching the Company</h2>

<ul>
<li>if a publicly traded company, examine its Annual Report, Proxy Statement, and 10-K (SEC filings and other corporate documents)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Negotiating a HIgher Salary</h2>

<ul>
<li>ask for the salary range long before the conversation comes up</li>
<li>ask for salary range the first time you meet the recruiter</li>
<li>"What is the salary range allocated for this position?"</li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions for Which to Prepare</h2>

<ul>
<li>Where do you see yourself in five/ten years?</li>
<li>What is your greatest weakness?

<ul>
<li>Choose an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5824470/choose-an-irrelevant-skill-when-asked-what-are-your-weaknesses-in-a-job-interview">irrelevant skill</a>.</li>
<li>ex: For example, "Well, accounting really isn't my thing. I understand the basic idea behind book keeping, but I don't really get the nitty-gritty details. Of course, that's also why I'm applying for this job in human resources. I think it leverages my strengths and steers clear of the technical skills that I haven't learned yet…like accounting."</li>
<li>"Instead of relying on statements like these, you can clearly answer the question by mentioning a more technical skill that you simply haven’t learned yet and then talk about why that pushes you towards the job you’re applying to get." </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do you want to work here?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sample questions to ask</h2>

<ul>
<li>How quickly does the company move on ideas (what is the typical time between releases)?</li>
<li>What would it take for an engineer to test out an idea on the live site/product?</li>
<li>Are groups very distinct or do they work in a more fluid manner?</li>
<li>How often do people move around between teams?</li>
<li>What is the rough ratio of managers to direct reports?</li>
<li>Do they have some sort of formal or informal mentoring program?</li>
<li>How much are you going to learn there?</li>
<li>Do they offer opportunities to grow and try new things?</li>
