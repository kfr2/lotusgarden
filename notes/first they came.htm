and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Jews,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Catholics,
and I didn't speak out because I was Protestant.</p>

<p>Then they came for me
and there was no one left to speak out for me.</p></blockquote>
