title: "Week 3:  EasyAww - look at cute pictures. feel better." 
category: potw

This week's project is an experiment in CSS3/HTML5 and overall styling.  (Soon enough, it's going to be a project in JS, JSON, and some kind of php/ruby backend.)  People often like to look at cute pictures but many sites have too much distracting text on them.  I feel people want to look at cute pictures and  not read walls of text while doing so!

Today, I'd like to introduce you to [EasyAww.com](http://www.easyaww.com), the site that lets you take time out of your day to enjoy the simpler (and cuter!) things in life.  Soon you will be able to look at images of all sorts of cute things, all appropriately tagged and (perhaps) rateable.

During the course of this week, I worked on creating a design for the site and establishing various ideas of how things will be implemented.  Next week, my project is to write various backend functionality including some type of JSON-based API, administration tools, and a form for allowing users to submit their own cute pictures.  I've also thought about allowing for Facebook and/or Twitter integration, but those steps are at least a few weeks away.

Look forward to seeing cute images soon!  If you have any thoughts, feel free to [let me know](/about.html).
