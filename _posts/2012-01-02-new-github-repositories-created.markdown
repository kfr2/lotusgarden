Over the past week or so, I have been adding repositories to my [GitHub account](https://github.com/kfr2/).  For instance, you can now view the [vim plugins](https://github.com/kfr2/vim-plugins) I find useful.  Furthermore, you may also view my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kfr2/dotfiles) to gain an understanding of how I have configured various portions of my [MacBook](/2011/12/24/slowly-transitioning-to-mac-os.html).  Although they may not be immediately useful to anybody else, that's perfectly fine:  should I ever need to reinstall parts of my system, the repositories will surely make things much easier!
