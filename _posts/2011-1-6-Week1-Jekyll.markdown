My project for this week was pretty simple.  I've been looking for an easy way to have a uniform look across my webpages without resorting to a bloated blog engine.  Fortunately, I found exactly what I was looking for in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static-file blog "compiler" written in Ruby.

It was a very simple project, indeed, but I've been working on a few private projects that are about ready for release.  Soon enough, I will have ample time to tinker to my heart's content!
