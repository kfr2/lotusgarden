Although I really liked the idea of completing a project every week, it's a bit too much of a stretch with my current schedule.  Therefore, I'm backing away from the task (temporarily, at least) and will focus on completing applications or projects of a better quality.

To begin, I've been experimenting with using [Posterous](https://posterous.com/) as a personal blog and may attempt to integrate it and/or [Twitter](http://twitter.com) with this site.  Although I have not (as of yet) looked into implementations for this, it should be pretty easy to figure out and will be a great addition for the site.

Until next time!
