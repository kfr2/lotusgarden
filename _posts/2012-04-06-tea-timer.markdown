Finding myself with a mostly-free afternoon, today I decided to create a [jQuery Mobile-based Tea Timer application](http://magically.us/projects/tea-time/).  Use it to monitor the steeping time and temperature of your favorite teas.  Although you can load it into a desktop browser, it will look much better when run on a mobile-based browser.
It's pretty easily extendable and can be turned into any number of desired timers.  Have fun!
