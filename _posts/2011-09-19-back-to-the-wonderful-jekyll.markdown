Unfortunately, it has been a very long time since I've last updated my personal site.  Indeed, after the VPS I was using to host it went kaput,
I tried moving to posterous temporarily and found it did not satiate my desire to explore various technologies and methodologies while I post about
various undertakings and adventures.  Fortunately, however, time has come for me to revamp this site (now hosted on the wonderful [NearlyFreeSpeech](http://nearlyfreespeech.net)
using the powerful [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby-powered static site generator.

This powerful tool offers many advantages and greatly complements my desires for this site.  Although I am a large fan of dynamically generated websites and greatly
enjoy creating them, not every website on the internet needs to have a database somewhere along its back end.  Indeed, many sites -- especially those that are personal or
otherwise light on information -- would function just fine if its files were static and only updated when the information existing on them changes.  By doing so, complexity is decreased
as security is increased, leaving one feel "warm and fuzzy" inside not needing to worry about opening up additional areas for potential exploitation by using dynamic technologies.
Jekyll accomplishes my goals in this area wonderfully by generating all the HTML files necessary for a site to operate based on a few, simple templates and various text-files containing
each post.  Stemming from this architecture, it's very easy to backup the site in its entirety as it is mostly text files with a small amount of special markup called [YAML Front Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter).
If you are so inclined, check out [this website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/kfr2/lotusgarden) to further understand the structure I've placed behind it.

Although I never know *exactly* what to do with my personal websites, this one will likely turn into a mild "portfolio" type presentation to showcase various applications
I've built or other projects I've worked on.  My year is turning out to be quite busy, so reports and code are forthcoming.  Until then, have a wonderful day!
