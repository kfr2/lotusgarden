title: "Small Housekeeping Changes"
categories: musings
---
Although I've been busy with school and outside projects, I've been really excited to start working on this website when I get a free afternoon to sit down and tinker with everything again as I really miss getting a chance to experience with ideas.  However, I suppose life duties including school, relationships, and other activities should take precedence at times.  Alas, I digress...

Nonetheless, I will start with a few housekeeping changes (such as removing the nginx logo from the footer as I've switched to the lovely [NearlyFreeSpeech.NET](http://nearlyfreespeech.net), a host utilizing the Apache web server.  Furthermore, I intend to completely overhaul this page (especially for mobile devices) to make it friendlier to use for somebody desiring information about myself or the projects and ideas I find interesting.  Unfortunately, I can't set a strict timeframe because of outside commitments, but I desire to have these changes implemented within approximately the next week so I can begin writing content that may be useful to the adventurers on the web.

Stay tuned!
