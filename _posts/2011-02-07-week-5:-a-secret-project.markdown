title: "Week 5: A Secret Project"

This past week has been quite full of all sorts of projects and I am moderately bummed I didn't release a new piece of code to the wild.  However, perhaps this isn't totally a bad thing as I've still been working on various things.  In addition to projects for school, I've been working pretty heavily on a Flex AIR-based application for a secret project.  Unfortunately I can't currently say very much about the specifics of the project, but it's sure to change the way you feel about ink!

Although I'm not entirely sure of my project for the upcoming week, I'm pretty certain it will be a form of generated infographics based on the prices I've been scraping from the [Magic Online Traders League price guide](http://www.magictraders.com/pricelists/) nightly.  Look for it soon!
