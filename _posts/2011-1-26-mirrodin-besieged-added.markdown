One of my loves in life is the trading card game Magic: the Gathering.  In commemoration of the prerelease events occuring this weekend (and to practice!), I've added Mirrodin Besieged to <a href="/magic/sealed" title="Magic: the Gathering sealed generator">my Magic: the Gathering sealed generator</a>.

Furthermore, I've tweaked a few small features on the site.  The static bar on your right provides easy links to my rss (technically atom) feed as well as a link to my twitter and <a href="http://about.me/krichardson" title="my about.me account">about.me</a> profile.  Consequently, I've been exploring Jekyll more and more, and it is fantastic!

Finally, look for my project of the week very soon!  Until then, stay classy.
