Gershon Bialer has a challenge to do [a website a day](http://www.websiteadaychallenge.com/) for the year. It's a terrific goal, but perhaps too large for my current tastes.  However, the idea of completing a website or other project every week is quite intriguing, so this site catalogues my humble attempts at this endeavor.  It won't all be good, but perhaps there will be gems in the rough.  Furthermore, it will be a fantastic learning experience and perhaps help me stretch my comfort zones and areas of expertise in the software development realm.  After all, the best way to learn how to develop or build something is to build tons of examples.  It's also a nifty way to write a ton to further my experience with Vim!

Not all of my projects will be web-based, but I imagine many of them will be.  In my opinion, web applications will become much more prevalent over the next few years as people do away with more traditional style of computers and computing.  I also really love microformats and microdata while believing whole heartedly in having small applications that do one thing very well, so perhaps some of my 
experimentation will be along the lines of integrating useful data from all over the web.

This journey will surely be quite interesting, so I hope you're as ready as I am!  Feel free to take what I create and extend it in your own way. Moreover, if you have any suggestions for projects past or present, feel free to [contact me](http://kevin.triageworks.net/about.html).

Godspeed.
