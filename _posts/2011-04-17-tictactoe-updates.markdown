I've added a very rudimentary computer opponent to my [Phyrexia versus Mirrodin TicTacToe](/projects/magic/tictactoe/) game!  Although it won't certainly put up any form of challenge (yet), it provides for a better game than playing both sides yourself.  Go ahead and challenge it to see who should *really* control Mirrodin!
