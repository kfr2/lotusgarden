title: "NearlyFreeSpeech.NET Move Complete"

Having been busy with school and other obligations, I've unfortunately not found a lot of time to work on finalizing my move of this site from the previous VPN-hosted solution to a NearlyFreeSpeech.NET-hosted solution.

As I've recently decided to use [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) again, compiling the site with Jekyll, uploading it to the new web server, and pushing any changes to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kfr2/lotusgarden) have become much more enjoyable and lovely through a simple modification to this site's [Rakefile](https://github.com/kfr2/lotusgarden/blob/master/Rakefile).
Instead of copying files manually by hand, I can write a post (using [newpost.sh](https://github.com/kfr2/lotusgarden/blob/master/newpost.sh)) and type "rake" at a shell to have the site and its repository updated.  Although there are certainly better ways of managing this deployment, I've found this process works incredibly well for me and saves a ton of time.

For a C# independent study course at school, I've been thinking of revamping [magically.us](http://magically.us) into a desktop-based Magic: the Gathering price speculation tool, so that's likely the next project I'll post to this site.  Until later, have a wonderful day and night!
