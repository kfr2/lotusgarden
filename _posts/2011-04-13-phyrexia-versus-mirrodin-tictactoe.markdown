Yesterday, I spent a bit of time creating a [Phyrexia versus Mirrodin TicTacToe game](/magic/tictactoe/) for my web applications class.  We weren't supposed to use jQuery or any other javascript libraries (as far as I know), so it's (as of the time this post was written) coded using regular javascript.  One day soon, I intend to add more features or various enhancements by utilizing jQuery and other powerful libraries, which will help clean up the code and simplifying a lot of the processing.

In preparation for the impending [New Phyrexia](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/677) Magic: the Gathering expansion, join sides with either Phyrexia or Mirrodin and battle for control of Mirrodin!  Eventually I intend to add a simple opponent AI and a simple statistics tracker so it will be known which side has a greater prowess for Tic Tac Toe!  Until then, battle on!
