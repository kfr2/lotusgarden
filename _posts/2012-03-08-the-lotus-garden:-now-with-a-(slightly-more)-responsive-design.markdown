Although I was quite happy with <a href="http://thesquaregrid.com/" title="The Square Grid">The Square Grid</a> as a CSS system for quite some time, I've always wanted this site to be a bit more friendly toward mobile users as mobile browsing is becoming incredibly popular all throughout the world.  Fortunately, today I found <a href="http://www.columnal.com/" title="Columnal">Columnal</a>, a self-described "responsive CSS grid system" focusing on "helping desktop and mobile browsers play nicely together."  Having spent some time converting this site to use the new system, I am quite happy with how easily and quickly one can work with Columnal.

Over the next few weeks, I hope to find enough time to refactor a bit of my older experiments enough to be able to upload them for the world's use.  (Plus, it doesn't hurt to acquire more practice with HTML, CSS, etc.)  Have a wonderful day!
