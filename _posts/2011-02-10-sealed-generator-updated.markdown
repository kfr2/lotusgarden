No major project announcements yet, although [EasyAww](http://www.easyaww.com) is coming along nicely and a preliminary version should be ready for testing sometime soon.  Furthermore, I have a few ideas planned for a Magic: the Gathering price information site that I'm pretty excited about.

Today I updated the [mtg sealed generator](/magic/sealed/) so it generates 3 packs of Scars of Mirrodin and 3 packs of Mirrodin Besieged.  If that's your cup of tea, enjoy!
