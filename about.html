                        <p>My goal in life is to create beautiful software that does best that which it is supposed to and nothing else.  Applications without a focus distract users from completing their tasks efficiently and hinder their ability to live a life in the real world.  Although I have interests in many areas of computer science, programming, and development (as well as in life itself), my current interests focus on creating responsive and intelligent applications with an intention of simplifying (rather than increasing) the amount of work a person has to complete to get things done.</p>
                        <p>Magically.us contains my experimentations and projects in various areas.  Although some many not be immediately useful to you, they've surely helped me mature and perhaps blossom as a software developer.  This garden is a testbed, so things might get messy.  Nonetheless, my projects are usually released under the <a href="/UNLICENSE" title="UNLICENSE">UNLICENSE</a>, so feel free to do whatever you wish with them.</p>
                        <p>I'm a tinkerer at heart.  Check out <a href="projects.html" title="Kevin Richardson's projects">my projects</a> to see that which upon I'm publicly experimenting.</p>
